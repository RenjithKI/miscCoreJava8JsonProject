 * @author Renjith
 * java.util.ConcurrentModificationException is a very common exception when working with java collection classes.
 *  Java Collection classes are fail-fast, which means if the Collection will be changed while 
 *  some thread is traversing over it using iterator, the iterator.next() will throw 
 *  ConcurrentModificationException. Concurrent modification exception
 *  can come in case of multithreaded as well as single threaded java programming environment.
